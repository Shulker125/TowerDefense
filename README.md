Red is the weakest and slowest, while gray is the fastest and strongest.

If a defensive projectile hits a virus of another color, the virus will lose a level, which means that it will change into the next weakest virus. For example, if a green virus is hit by a projectile, it will turn into a blue virus, and if the blue virus is hit, it will turn into a red virus. When a red virus is hit, the virus will disappear and the player will earn money.
